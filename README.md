# 🏆 Clash Royale Chest System – UI & Logic Clone (Unity)

As part of my upskilling journey at **Outscal**, I took on an exciting design challenge: **Recreate the Clash Royale Chest System UI and Logic from Scratch**.

The goal wasn’t just to copy the visuals — but to **replicate the system’s core logic and lifecycle**, implementing it with **clean code architecture** and **multiple design patterns** used in professional game development.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- ✅ How to implement a complete **Chest Management System** with unlock timers, state transitions, and UI updates.
- ✅ Applying multiple design patterns (State, Command, MVC, etc.) in a real-world scenario.
- ✅ Planning with **UML diagrams** and UI wireframes before diving into development.
- ✅ Building a **modular, testable**, and **scalable** game system architecture.

## 🕹️ Gameplay/System Overview

- 🎁 Players earn and store chests in slots.
- ⏳ Each chest goes through a **lifecycle**: Locked → Unlocking → Unlocked → Collected.
- 🛒 Undo functionality allows reversing chest purchases.
- 🖼️ UI closely replicates **Clash Royale's iconic style**.

## ✅ Design Patterns Implemented

| Pattern                    | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MVC Architecture**       | Used in <b>Player</b> and <b>Chest</b> mechanics.        |
| **State Pattern**          | Manages chest lifecycle states and transitions.                         |
| **Command Pattern**        | Adds undo support for chest purchases.                 |
| **Dependency Injection**   | Injects services into systems for decoupling and easier testing.        |
| **Object Pooling**         | Efficiently manages reused chest objects.                        |
| **Event-Driven Architecture** | Decouples systems via events for better scalability and flexibility.  |

## 📐 Planning Artifacts

- 🎨 **UI Layout** designed in **Miro** before development.
- 📊 **Project Architecture Diagram** created to map out core architecture and chest state flow.

---

## 📚 Key Takeaways

- Applied **multiple patterns** together in one cohesive system.
- Reinforced good practices like **planning first**, **decoupling**, and **single responsibility**.
- Built an experience that mirrors a real-world live game system.
